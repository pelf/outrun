Sunday Game Dev #1
==================

Me and some friends decided to get together on random sunday afternoons and try to code something we never coded before (basically, games). 

We'll try to create an Outrun clone from scratch: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OutRun

I'll be using processing.js, kenjin will be using LISP (*gasp*), slitz C#, fred objective-c and fabio javascript. Here we go!
