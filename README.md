Sunday Game Dev #1
==================

Me and some friends decided to get together on random sunday afternoons and try to code something we never coded before (basically, games). 

We'll try to create an Outrun clone from scratch: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OutRun

I'll be using processing.js, kenjin will be using LISP (*gasp*), slitz C#, fred objective-c and fabio javascript. Here we go!

*EDIT*
-------
I've done better than I expected in a few hours. It turned out kind of OK. I wasn't sure I'd be able to fake hills and corners, but I did. *pat on the back*

Code is ugly and all tangled up. This was coded in a rush and being the first time doing this kind of thing, I wasn't sure how to structure the code. Next sunday it'll be better! ;)
